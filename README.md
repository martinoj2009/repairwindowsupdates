Repair Windows Updates

This is a program I wrote to replace a batch file I wrote a while back to fix Windows Updates issues.
This tool has 2 run methods, you can either open the file and run it, or you can pass two optional arguments:
/q and/or /clean

Right now, as of 20150518, you have to pass in the order of /q then /clean, not /clean /q, or just /clean, as I now see as I'm writing this that I should have checked arguments differently... I can fix that later, it's late now lol.

This is a hobby project, but I do use it, and it has fixed pretty much every Windows Updates issue I have ran into.
